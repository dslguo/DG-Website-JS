# Dominic Guo's Self Introductory Website

## Hi there!

## Hope you've had the chance to check out my website and learn more about me.

I created this website as a side-project to practice the frontend fundamentals of coding with vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

In my spare time, I come back here to refresh my frontend skills as well as add any cool front-end features which I may have picked up on my Software Engineering Journey, such as the cool navbar scroll effect.

In terms of Git Management, I've realised that my git commit naming has been horrible; however, as of 11/08/2021, I'll try to follow software industry git management conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/, so that the code maintenance team (if there ever will be one), won't have such a hard time.
